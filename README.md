# Gitmod

It’s an open source community that shares ideas, code, and mods with each other. Game mods can be done in a variety of ways such as unpacking files or modifying the code of a game to manipulate it. The game modding is largely done using open source methods. This means that the code and instructions are put into online repositories where anyone can use and implement them. Open source coding is essentially a software industry standard. In fact, “93% of companies use open source for non-commercial or internal reasons.” Game modding can be a good way to introduce open source concepts and structure to someone young. In information settings, such as libraries with teen programs, there has been an increased focus on providing tools and tutorials for young adults to find some sort of passion with technology. Libraries have begun to offer classes on coding, video editing, and creating makerspaces for their users. As the gaming community continues to grow, a library that offered a class on game modding could create the passion in a young adult for game development that could lead them down a successful career path later on.

# Problems Solved:

Censorship Resistance: Decentralization prevents a single entity from controlling or censoring content. Traditional platforms may restrict or remove mods for various reasons, but a decentralized platform would allow for greater freedom of expression.
Ownership and Control: In traditional platforms, users and content creators have limited control over their data and mods. A decentralized platform would give users more ownership and control over their contributions and identities.
Trust and Transparency: Decentralized platforms leverage blockchain or similar technologies to record transactions and decisions transparently. This enhances trust among users, as they can verify actions and governance decisions on the blockchain.
Fair Compensation: Content creators often face challenges in monetizing their mods on traditional platforms. A decentralized platform can enable fair compensation through token-based incentives and peer-to-peer transactions.
Data Privacy: Decentralized identity systems and encryption can enhance user data privacy and security. Users can have greater confidence that their personal information is not misused.



# Functions of a Decentralized Modding Community Platform:

Decentralized Storage: Use decentralized file storage systems like IPFS to store mod files securely and ensure their availability. This prevents reliance on a single central server.
User-Centric Identities: Implement decentralized identity solutions to give users control over their identity information while maintaining privacy and security.
Token-Based Incentives: Create a native token or cryptocurrency to incentivize and reward content creators, active participants, and moderators within the community.
Smart Contract Governance: Develop smart contracts for decentralized governance, enabling users to propose and vote on decisions, such as mod approvals, rule changes, and platform upgrades.
Peer-to-Peer Distribution: Facilitate the peer-to-peer distribution of mods, allowing users to download and share content directly with one another.
Transparent Decision History: Record all community decisions, proposals, and actions on a blockchain or decentralized ledger to ensure transparency and accountability.
Community Moderation: Implement a system for content moderation and dispute resolution, potentially involving elected or community-driven moderators.
Interoperability: Strive for interoperability with various games and platforms to allow mods created within the community to be used across different gaming ecosystems.
Monetization Options: Enable creators to monetize their mods through direct peer-to-peer transactions or by earning tokens for popular and high-quality mods.
Community Building Tools: Offer forums, chat rooms, event hosting capabilities, and collaboration tools to foster community engagement and interaction among members.
Legal Compliance Education: Provide resources and guidelines to educate users and creators about copyright and intellectual property laws to prevent legal issues.
Scalability and Sustainability: Plan for scalability and long-term sustainability through funding models like donations, sponsorship deals, or additional token offerings.



Current game modding community platforms, while valuable, do have several issues and limitations that can affect the modding experience for creators and users. Some common problems include:

- Centralization: Many modding platforms are centralized, meaning they are owned and controlled by a single entity. This centralization can lead to issues related to content control, censorship, and a lack of user control.
- Content Censorship: Centralized platforms may censor or remove mods for various reasons, such as intellectual property concerns or subjective judgments about content. This can stifle creativity and limit freedom of expression.
- Lack of Transparency: Users and modders often have limited insight into the decision-making processes of centralized platforms. This lack of transparency can lead to distrust and frustration within the community.
- Intellectual Property Concerns: Modders may face legal challenges related to intellectual property rights when creating and sharing mods. Centralized platforms may not provide adequate guidance or protection in these situations.
- Monetization Challenges: Modders often struggle to monetize their work effectively. Centralized platforms may take a significant share of mod sales or offer limited monetization options.
- Security and Privacy: Centralized platforms can be vulnerable to security breaches, data leaks, and privacy issues. Users may have concerns about the handling of their personal information.
- Limited Interoperability: Mods created for one game or platform may not be easily transferable to others, limiting the reach and usability of mods.
- Inefficient Distribution: Traditional modding platforms rely on centralized servers for file distribution, which can lead to slow download speeds and server downtime.
- Lack of User Control: Users may have limited control over their data and identities on centralized platforms, raising concerns about data ownership and security.
- Community Disputes: Handling disputes and conflicts within the modding community can be challenging on centralized platforms. Decisions may be subjective and lack transparency.
- Sustainability and Funding: Maintaining and funding modding platforms can be challenging. Some platforms may struggle to provide essential services and support for the long term.
- Lack of Collaboration Tools: Collaboration among modders and community members can be hindered by a lack of effective tools and features for communication and teamwork.
